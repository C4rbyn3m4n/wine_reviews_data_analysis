## Section 1. Introduction
Our project investigates ~120,000 wine reviews with characteristics such as variety, vintage, winery, price, and etc.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan
Exploratory Questions:

1. What is the best wine? Normalize data based on each user?

2. Best bang for buck wine based on rating?

3. Best wine is the best variety, best wine province, number of wines per province

4. Based on user twitter handle determine location of reviewers

5. Point distribution

6. Most/Least expensive wine

Our intent is to use the following functions:

* join()

* groupBy()

* n()

* mean()

* max()/min()

* summarize()

* filter()

Libraries used:

* ggplot

* rtweet

* tidyverse


### Extra Ideas

* Determine traits of reviews based on tweet (ex: all like basketball)

* Determine best wine given user taste profile (not sure how to do this yet)
